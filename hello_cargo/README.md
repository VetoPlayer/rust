This folder and all of its configuration inside has been created by:

cargo new hello_cargo --bin 

The --bin argument passed to cargo makes up a binary executable opposed to
a library instead.
The files automatically generated are:

-> Cargo.toml: This is a configuration file. Its extension is in toml, which
            stands for Tom's Obvious Minimal Language
            [TODO ADD some more reference to this]
-> /src: Folder containing your source code.
         Cargo expects your source files to live in the src directory
-> Cargo.lock: This file keeps track of all the dependencies and their version
for you. This is actually generated by `cargo build` but you shouldn't need to
edit this manually.


A git repository is automatically generated and a default .gitignore is created
as well.

* Building and Running a Cargo Project

In order to build a Cargo Project:

`cargo build`

This command creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_world
You can now use your build artifact easily, just run:

`./target/debug/hello_world`

This is useful if you actually need to separate the build and run step.
But usually what you really want to do is to compile your program and see it
running... In order to achieve this in a single command:

`cargo run`

Another interesting commmand is

`cargo check`

That actually just checks your program compiles without actually producing an
executable
This is really fast if compare to the whole compilation step :)
While you develop the commands you'll be more likely to execute are the
following:

`cargo check`
`cargo build/cargo run`

When you feel ready for actually realeasing your code instead:

`cargo build --relese`

To build your project for release purposes`
